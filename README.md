#Bus Finder 2.0
This is a complete rebuild of [Bus Finder](https://github.com/mathewhawley/bus_finder).

This is an exercise to better learn several development tools and processes that are new to me. Hopefully the standard of code will be cleaner, leaner and more modularâ€”reflecting greater understanding.

At this stage I'll be aiming to employ:

* SASS
* Gulp
* JSPM
* SystemJS
* React
* ES6
